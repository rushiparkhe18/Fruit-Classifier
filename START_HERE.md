## 📱 How the APK Works

Your APK uses **Trusted Web Activity (TWA)** technology:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│    Android APK          │  ← Small container (5-10 MB)
│  (Native app wrapper)   │
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │
            ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Your Flask Web App    │  ← Hosted online (HTTPS)
│  (Running on server)    │
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │
            ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  TensorFlow ML Model    │  ← AI processing
│  Blockchain System      │  ← Verification
│  All Features           │  ← Everything works!
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Why This Is Great:
- ✅ No code rewriting needed
- ✅ All web features work perfectly
- ✅ Easy updates (just update web app)
- ✅ Small APK size
- ✅ Native app experience
- ✅ Works offline (cached content)
